After careful evaluation of the 3.1 features in RC2, we recognized the need to make some adjustments. There are some significant differences from previous versions of 3.1, so <strong>please</strong> review the changes if you have been developing against a beta or RC version.</p>\n<p>The biggest change is the removal of AJAX list tables, which had been an effort to move all of our list-style screens to full AJAX for pagination, searches, and column sorts, and to consolidate the list-style screens into a single API that plugins could leverage. Unfortunately, with more testing came realizations that there were too many major bugs and usability issues with how the functionality was implemented, so we&#8217;ve spent the last week rolling back the most important portions of the feature.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For users:</strong> AJAX has been entirely disabled for the list tables. We hope to bring this back again, in a form that is properly and fully implemented, in a future release. Column sorting remains, but everything else has returned to its 3.0 state.</li>\n<li><strong>For developers:</strong> The entire list table API is now marked <em>private</em>. If you attempt to leverage new components of the API, you are pretty much guaranteeing that your plugins will break in a future release, so please don&#8217;t do that. <img src=\'http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\' alt=\':-)\' class=\'wp-smiley\' />  We hope to enable all the fun new goodies for public use in a future release.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the only way we could prevent any regressions in functionality and usability from WordPress 3.0 to 3.1. That&#8217;s right, users and plugin authors can still do everything you used to be able to do (and a little bit more).</p>\n<p>Because of the code churn between RC2 and RC3, <strong>this release candidate needs a lot of testing</strong>. Every list screen needs testing. In particular, the comment moderation screen needs testing, especially with keyboard shortcuts (if you didn&#8217;t know about those, now&#8217;s your chance to try them out).</p>\n<p>Other fixes in RC3 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Properly display the author dropdown in Quick Edit</li>\n<li>Various important fixes to numerous taxonomy query variables</li>\n<li>Fixes to the theme deletion process</li>\n<li>Fixes to pages used for posts</li>\n<li>IIS and Multisite: Avoid resetting web.config on permalink save</li>\n<li>Properly validate post formats and their rewrite rules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m assembling a group of friends in Washington, D.C., this weekend to test WordPress 3.1 and provide feedback.

Because these factors vary, we have several levels of contributors to the core WordPress application, ranging from full-time lead developers to casual one-patch contributors.</p>\n<p>I loved it when that Intel commercial in 2009 gave Ajay Bhatt, co-inventor of the USB, some recognition as a rock star of geekland (though I hated it that it wasn&#8217;t actually Ajay Bhatt, but an actor &#8212; way to kill the message, Intel).<sup>1</sup> In WordPress-land, most people know who Matt Mullenweg is, but most of the other leaders and contributors are much less visible. Moving forward, I&#8217;m going to be posting profiles here of some of our more dedicated contributors.</p>\n<p>Why now? We&#8217;re coming up on the second annual WordPress core leadership meetup in January 2011, and we&#8217;re thinking we&#8217;ll hold a video town hall at some point during our time together. Between now and then the profiles I post will be of the core developers who will be at the meetup. After that, I&#8217;ll be branching out and posting about other contributors, including developers, designers, forum moderators, etc.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll post here in January when we have dates/times set for the video town hall. In the meantime, you can submit questions for us to answer then in the forum thread <a title=\"Suggestions thread\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/what-should-2011-hold-for-wordpress?\">What Should 2011 Hold for WordPress?</a></p>\n<p>To get a sense of how all these people fit together and how decisions are made, you can check out the presentation I did at WordCamp Portland in October on <a title=\"How WordPress Decisions Get Made video\" href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2010/09/18/jane-wells-how-wordpress-decisions-get-made/\">How WordPress Decisions Get Made</a><span style=\"font-size: 11.6667px\">.</span></p>\n<p><sup>1 &#8211; And how lame is it that Conan O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s interview with the real Ajay Bhatt is no longer available on the The Tonight Show&#8217;s website, and everyone&#8217;s embedded videos are blank?

If you find problems, let your plugin/theme authors know so they can figure out the cause.</li>\n<li>If any known issues crop up, you&#8217;ll be able to <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5\">find them here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are testing the release candidate and think you&#8217;ve found a bug, there are a few ways to let us know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post it to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a></li>\n<li>Report it to the <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers\">wp-testers mailing list</a></li>\n<li>Join the development IRC channel and tell us live at irc.freenode.net #wordpress-dev</li>\n<li>File a bug ticket on the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Trac</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To test WordPress 3.1, try the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a> (you&#8217;ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;).

Some of the new features to check out include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post Formats (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14746\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14746\">#14746</a>)</li>\n<li>Theme Search (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14936\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14936\">#14936</a>)</li>\n<li>Internal Linking (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11420\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11420\">#11420</a>)</li>\n<li>Admin Bar (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14772\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14772\">#14772</a>)</li>\n<li>Ajaxified Admin (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14579\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14579\">#14579</a>)</li>\n<li>Updated Tiny MCE (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12574\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12574\">#12574</a>)</li>\n<li>Multi-taxonomy Queries (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12891\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12891\">#12891</a>)</li>\n<li>Custom Post Type Index Pages (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13818\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13818\">#13818</a>)</li>\n<li>Admin CSS Cleanup (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14770\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14770\">#14770</a>)</li>\n<li>User Admin (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14696\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14696\">#14696</a>)</li>\n<li>Network Admin (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14435\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14435\">#14435</a>)</li>\n<li>Password Reset Redux (<a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5919\">#5919</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also some known issues: things that aren&#8217;t *quite* finished, but that weren&#8217;t worth holding up the beta release. They will be fixed before 3.1 is released for general use. Note that as things get fixed, the beta release will update nightly. What you should know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fatal error: Call to a member function is_page() on a non-object in /wp-includes/query.php. is_page() may be <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags\">any conditional tag</a>. This issue occurs when a theme or plugin is doing something wrong. Some code is checking the value of a conditional tag before we actually set up the Query, which means they don&#8217;t work yet. In 3.0, they silently failed and always returned false. In 3.1 Beta 1, this is throwing a fatal error. This will be handled in the final release, so use this opportunity to fix your plugins. (<a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14579\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14729\">#14729</a>)</li>\n<li>All known issues slated for fixing before launch are <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=reopened&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reviewing&amp;status=new&amp;status=accepted&amp;group=status&amp;milestone=3.1\">listed in Trac</a>. Please check this list to see if a bug is already on the list before reporting it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, if you find something you think is a bug, report it! You can bring it up in the <a title=\"Alpha/Beta Support Forum\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">alpha/beta forum</a>, you can email it to the <a title=\"WP-testers mailing list info page\" href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers\">wp-testers list</a>, or if you&#8217;ve confirmed that other people are experiencing the same bug, you can report it on the <a title=\"WordPress Core Trac\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Core Trac</a>.

There are other plugins that let you customize the login screen logo. But this one works with <strong>zero configuration</strong>. You just create the logo (PNG image with a transparent background), name it <code>login-logo.png</code>, and drop it into your <code>/wp-content/</code> directory.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_560\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://markjaquith.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/screenshot-1.png?w=420&h=365\" alt=\"\" title=\"screenshot-1\" width=\"420\" height=\"365\" class=\"size-full wp-image-560\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Here is an example modified login form</p></div>\n<p>The plugin takes care of generating the correct CSS, based on the image&#8217;s size.

I&#8217;m pretty excited about the Post Formats feature slated for WordPress 3.1, developers have been taken aback by the lack of flexibility or customization that can be performed with them. Many developers have been wondering how these post formats can be extended or how they can add some of their own. Although WordPress has always had hooks and filters to customize features added into the core, Post Formats strays from that routine by strongly discouraging straying from the standardized post formats. </p>\n<p>Andrew Nacin, a WordPress core developer <a href=\"http://andrewnacin.com/2011/01/27/on-standardized-post-formats\">outlines why Post Formats work the way they do</a>. It&#8217;s important to note that Post Formats won&#8217;t be for everyone.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With term names and such, we went through great lengths to ensure formats were as portable as possible. The idea behind the feature is this standardization and portability for a segment of bloggers. Many designers of themes used for microblogging wanted this ability to offer structured, well-defined content, beyond what could be done with categories and tags. It’s designed so when you switch to a different theme — a specific kind of theme, at that — your content doesn’t lose its most fundamental context.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Staying within the confines of the Post Formats standard will be good for all users but custom implementations will lead to problems when it comes time to switch themes. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Ultimately, this feature is an exception of the rule. It’s not like we decided we liked the idea of post formats and then later came across the idea to force them to be standardized. No, the idea we started with — before we had a name for them, even — was the standardization itself. The only new thing this feature brings to the table is the portability enabled through standardization.

The WordPress HelpCenter was a company aimed at providing support for plug-ins and themes to offload the support burden from developers. As Alex points out, the company was not able to gain traction with developers. But the nail in the coffin for something like WP HelpCenter is that commercial support for free plug-ins and themes was not something people were <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/twitter-tools-no-longer-posts-to-twitter#post-1876810\">willing to pay for.</a> Alex believes that the service WP HelpCenter provided is still needed in the WordPress community and for anyone else willing to dive into the market, he shares the following tips:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would recommend getting funding in place so that you can hire and do internal training, then come to market with a 5-6 person team (with dedicated sales and project management roles) in place from the start. Then it’s just a matter of providing great service and doing smart marketing to generate revenue. I would also recommend including a training offering, as that seems to be a service many people find valuable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It will be interesting to see who steps into the market that WP HelpCenter is leaving behind and if they do things a different way to become successful. Meanwhile. Alex&#8217;s development company <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/jobs/\">CrowdFavorite is doing very well</a> with job openings available. </p>\n<img

While most of his questions are good ones, I&#8217;d say one of the most important is the aspect of support after you pay. Some commercial plugin providers have switched from unlimited support for the lifetime of the product to yearly subscriptions. For example, a plugin may cost $50.00 for the initial purchase which includes a year of support and upgrades but after the first year, you can opt to pay $25.00 for support or only the upgrades. So far, I&#8217;ve had great success with the money I&#8217;ve spent on commercial plugins but thoroughly do your research before you spend anything. </p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/hpwO3Xge3jM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 21:43:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"Alex King: HelpCenter Shutting Down, Crowd Favorite is Hiring\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"http://alexking.org/?p=5375\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://alexking.org/blog/2011/01/25/helpcenter-shutting-down\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4930:\"<p><a href=\"http://wphelpcenter.com\">WordPress HelpCenter</a> will be ceasing operations on February 28th. Between now and then we will be working with existing customers to wrap up all of our committed projects, but we will not be taking on any new projects. For customers that purchased WPHC support for the <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/themes/carrington-business/\">Carrington Business theme</a>, we have created a special premium support offering through <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com\">Crowd Favorite</a> to fulfill your support needs from March 1 forward.<sup><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn1295989949726n\" id=\"fn1295989949726\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/5387932563/\" title=\"WordPress HelpCenter is shutting down Feb 28th by alexkingorg, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5256/5387932563_820936b589_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"217\" alt=\"WordPress HelpCenter is shutting down Feb 28th\" /></a></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the summary, here are the details.</p>\n<p>This was a really tough decision for me. When I <a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/2009/04/13/wordpress-helpcenter\">created the HelpCenter</a> I had a couple of goals for it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide a support and quick-turn development service to the WordPress community that I think it desperately needs.</li>\n<li>Provide relief for plugin and theme developers that don&#8217;t wish to offer support, and give their users a good resource for support when they need assistance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I never expected it to be a very profitable service due to the nature of the work we were targeting, but I thought it would fill a significant need.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we were not able to get the traction with developers that I was hoping for. Part of that may have been due to the $1 payout amount, so we were planning to increase that to 10% and created a set of tools to make it really easy for developers to include in their plugins. We never made this change or released these tools because their readiness coincided with the culmination of feedback from the community that commercial support for free plugins and themes just <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/twitter-tools-no-longer-posts-to-twitter#post-1876810\" rel=\"external\">wasn&#8217;t something they were willing to pay for</a>.</p>\n<p>When we initially started the service, we did so as a partnership with another hosting and development company. Unfortunately, didn&#8217;t work out as I&#8217;d hoped and <a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/2009/12/07/wordpress-helpcenter-staffed-by-crowd-favorite\">we brought it in-house</a> and hired full time staff to help it grow. Since then we had as many as 4 full time staff on board.</p>\n<p>Hiring for WPHC was extremely difficult. We needed generalists that knew WordPress very well, that were also personable and comfortable talking with customers. It&#8217;s a hard combination to find, and harder still to find at a salary range that the WPHC projects could support. Ultimately many of them left, tired of dealing with the fraction of our customers that were rude and unpleasant.</p>\n<p>My experience building businesses is to grow them organically. This has worked well for Crowd Favorite and <a href=\"http://backupmoxie.com\">BackupMoxie</a>, and is working nicely for <a href=\"http://cloudmoxie.com\">CloudMoxie</a>; however it didn&#8217;t work well for WPHC.</p>\n<p>In retrospect (and as advice for the next person who decides to create a service like this), a different approach would have probably worked much better. I would recommend getting funding in place so that you can hire and do internal training, then come to market with a 5-6 person team (with dedicated sales and project management roles) in place from the start. Then it&#8217;s just a matter of providing great service and doing smart marketing to generate revenue. I would also recommend including a training offering, as that seems to be a service many people find valuable.</p>\n<p>I still think the concept of the WPHC is an important one for the WordPress community, and a service that is very much needed now that WordPress has made the transition from Open Source project to a product that many folks (who do not consider themselves technical) rely on and use on a daily basis. I hope that next foray into this space is more successful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>At the same time, Crowd Favorite is flourishing nicely. We&#8217;ve got a number of open positions right now, including <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/jobs/\">spots for interns and more experienced developers</a>.</p>\n<ol class=\"footnotes\">\n<li id=\"fn1295989949726n\">You will receive an email about this shortly.

alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" />The entire Automattic <a href=\"http://vip.wordpress.com\"><strong>VIP Services</strong></a> team (minus Lloyd, who thankfully held down the support queue!) spent the past week in London to talk strategy, fraternize, and meet with existing and prospective VIP clients in the area.</p>\n<p>We had a VIP meetup one night, and we were pleased by the turnout and the conversations that were flying between the guests, both VIP project owners and developers alike. We continue to expand our <a href=\"http://vip.wordpress.com\">VIP Services</a> offerings for both self-hosted and  WordPress.com VIPs, and the response has been very, very positive. One thing to us is clear &#8211; <strong>demand for WordPress is increasing</strong>, and our clients are hungry to apply it to all their upcoming projects.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re even happier when we tell them, &#8220;<strong>Yes, WordPress can do that, too!</strong>&#8221; Here on the Publisher blog, we&#8217;ll continue to highlight some of those outside-of-the-blog uses of WordPress (yep, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2010/11/cms-award/\">it&#8217;s a CMS</a>, too) that are becoming the driving force behind new enterprise adoption of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who came out for a drink &amp; a chat &#8211; and we look forward to another VIP meetup closer to where you are!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like more information about <a href=\"http://vip.wordpress.com\"><strong>VIP Services for your WordPress site</strong></a>, be sure to contact us!</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1172 aligncenter\" title=\"Automattic VIP

your calendars: <a title=\"WordCamp San Francisco\" href=\"http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org\">WordCamp San Francisco</a>, the official annual WordPress conference, will be August 12-14, 2011. This year will mark the 5th anniversary of WordCamp, and as always will feature Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s &#8220;State of the Word&#8221; address as well as a variety of amazing speakers that you&#8217;d normally only get to see at expensive industry conferences. This year the program will be expanded to three days, with programming for publishers, bloggers, and developers. There will also be related activities, like core team summits, workshops  for contributors, designers, and local organizers, and various professional and networking events. The planning is just beginning, so save the date on your calendar and keep an eye on the <a title=\"WordCamp SF 2011\" href=\"http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp SF 2011</a> site (and/or follow the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/WordCampSF\">@wordcampsf</a> twitter account) for updates as details become available.</p>\n<p>*For people who attended WordCamp SF last year who thought the annual event this year would be called WordCon, with WordCamp SF becoming a more locally-oriented event, you can read <a title=\"What\'s in a Name?

Stewart who is now a theme wrangler for Automattic started a tradition a few years ago. Each year, he would round up a collection of thoughts and predictions from notable people within the WordPress community to discuss what the future of themes were for that year. I&#8217;ve had the privilege to participate in the <a href=\"http://themeshaper.com/the-future-of-wordpress-themes/\">discussion for 2008</a> as well <a href=\"http://themeshaper.com/future-wordpress-themes-2009/\">as 2009</a>. Unfortunately, the tradition was broken in 2010 but in 2011, Ryan Imel of WPCandy.com <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/presents/the-future-of-wordpress-themes-in-2011\">has taken over the reigns</a>. </p>\n<p>This year, my prediction was very simple. Custom Taxonomies, Custom Post Types, and Post Formats. While developers will go crazy with the first two, I expect the most exciting development for this year to center around Post Formats along with their look and feel for themes. Definitely give the post a read as Ryan manage to get a handful of people I&#8217;ve never heard of to provide their two cents on themes for 2011. </p>\n<img

After careful evaluation of the 3.1 features in RC2, we recognized the need to make some adjustments. There are some significant differences from previous versions of 3.1, so <strong>please</strong> review the changes if you have been developing against a beta or RC version.</p>\n<p>The biggest change is the removal of AJAX list tables, which had been an effort to move all of our list-style screens to full AJAX for pagination, searches, and column sorts, and to consolidate the list-style screens into a single API that plugins could leverage. Unfortunately, with more testing came realizations that there were too many major bugs and usability issues with how the functionality was implemented, so we&#8217;ve spent the last week rolling back the most important portions of the feature.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For users:</strong> AJAX has been entirely disabled for the list tables. We hope to bring this back again, in a form that is properly and fully implemented, in a future release. Column sorting remains, but everything else has returned to its 3.0 state.</li>\n<li><strong>For developers:</strong> The entire list table API is now marked <em>private</em>. If you attempt to leverage new components of the API, you are pretty much guaranteeing that your plugins will break in a future release, so please don&#8217;t do that. <img src=\"http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />  We hope to enable all the fun new goodies for public use in a future release.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the only way we could prevent any regressions in functionality and usability from WordPress 3.0 to 3.1. That&#8217;s right, users and plugin authors can still do everything you used to be able to do (and a little bit more).</p>\n<p>Because of the code churn between RC2 and RC3, <strong>this release candidate needs a lot of testing</strong>. Every list screen needs testing. In particular, the comment moderation screen needs testing, especially with keyboard shortcuts (if you didn&#8217;t know about those, now&#8217;s your chance to try them out).</p>\n<p>Other fixes in RC3 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Properly display the author dropdown in Quick Edit</li>\n<li>Various important fixes to numerous taxonomy query variables</li>\n<li>Fixes to the theme deletion process</li>\n<li>Fixes to pages used for posts</li>\n<li>IIS and Multisite: Avoid resetting web.config on permalink save</li>\n<li>Properly validate post formats and their rewrite rules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m assembling a group of friends in Washington, D.C., this weekend to test WordPress 3.1 and provide feedback. We&#8217;d love to see this idea catch on among friends at coffee shops around the world. (We&#8217;ll blog our results, and we&#8217;re thinking about using the hashtag #wptest on Twitter.) If you are testing the release candidate and think you&#8217;ve found a bug, there are a few ways to let us know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post it to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a></li>\n<li>Report it to the <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers\">wp-testers mailing list</a></li>\n<li>Join the development IRC channel and tell us live at irc.freenode.net #wordpress-dev</li>\n<li>File a bug ticket on the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Trac</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To test WordPress 3.1, try the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a> (you&#8217;ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.1-RC3.zip\">download the release candidate here</a> (zip).</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to study this release carefully to see where we can improve on our internal processes in the future. With that, our requisite haiku, authored by Jane:</p>\n<p>Pulling the AJAX &#8211;<br />\nsometimes you need to step back<br />\nand show some restraint.</p>\n<p>Happy

book should become a staple in the hands of any developer working with WordPress. </p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/nEixbmWV-IU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"

First with eight kids, she taught all subjects as an after school program. By 1981, she was teaching 150 children, as they spilled out into the yard. Her daughter Krupa and son Sathya grew up in this environment, and they would teach students in the grade below them. Sathya went on to become a software professional, and Krupa became a successful entrepreneur. By 2001, her pursuits led her through India, Italy, Brazil, Japan, Malaysia, Srilanka, and Indonesia into the granite industry in the United States. This history combined a fundamental belief in the importance of education and a global perspective on the social problems of India. \r\n\r\nOut of a passion to create opportunities for deprived children, Krupa ended her lucrative career in the United States after a four-week vacation to India during summer of 2002. She setup SUKRUPA and then in 2008, created the social enterprise SUKRUPA Creations, which employs the children\'s parents.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"subarea lhside\">\r\n<h2>Our People</h2>\r\nThe Board consists of highly successful professionals, with a vision and passion to work with underprivileged children.

Nagar, Bangalore, providing a safe, caring, and clean environment for the children to live and learn in while their parents work.\r\n<h1>Our Programs</h1>\r\nWe holistically nurture the children and community by providing:\r\n<ul class=\"lined\">\r\n	<li>Free Schooling, from pre school through Class 10</li>\r\n	<li>Youth Training in life skills and distant learning</li>\r\n	<li>Community and Rural Development</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Residential Program</h3>\r\nThe SUKRUPA residential program runs a stable, full-time home for up to 10 children. In this loving family environment, children who are orphaned, have single parents or come from families in crisis receive affection, nutrition and guidance. They are provided schooling, education, health care and nutrition, discipline, and mentoring so that they develop as any other child would.\r\n<div class=\"subarea lhside\" style=\"width: 275px;\">\r\n<h2>Why It Matters</h2>\r\nChildren at SUKRUPA come from urban slum communities around Bangalore and are mostly first generation learners.\r\n\r\nMany of them come from families whose monthly income is less than Rs. 2,000, which is <strong>less than $50.00</strong>. This leads to a lack of basic needs – like education, health care, and nutrition – and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty.\r\n\r\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Sukrupa Education Center</h3>\r\nSUKRUPA Education Centre currently provides free schooling, nutritious food and basic health care to a population of over 400 children who thrive in a clean, safe, friendly and happy environment.\r\n\r\n<em>Student Eligibility and Parent Involvement</em>\r\nSUKRUPA conducts a strict screening process including home visits to determine below of poverty line status and requires a 14 to 16 year commitment of attendance. At the time of admission the parent makes an agreement with SUKRUPA to observe all rules and regulations and to attend child development training sessions every three months. Individual counseling is available per need.\r\n\r\n<em>The Curriculum</em>\r\nThe integrated curriculum at SUKRUPA is distinguished particularly by its emphasis on teaching the arts, social values and right attitude, in addition to academics as essential to a balanced education that produces young adults who are fiscally independent and personally responsible.\r\n\r\nSchool activities include:\r\n<ul class=\"lined\">\r\n	<li>Academics: Both innovative and traditional teaching methods</li>\r\n	<li>Languages: English, Kannada, Hindi, German and French</li>\r\n	<li>Fine Arts</li>\r\n	<li>Crafts</li>\r\n	<li>Theater</li>\r\n	<li>Indian and Western Classical Music and Dance</li>\r\n	<li>Sports</li>\r\n	<li>Club Projects in English, Math, Science, Geography, Sports and Horticulture</li>\r\n	<li>Field Trips</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Youth Training Program</h3>\r\nFor older children and teens who have been child laborers or school drop-outs, the SUKRUPA Youth Training Program is a five year curriculum in personal life skills, social skills, leadership and academics studied through distance learning, provided by the state university.\r\n\r\nPractical training in teaching, accounting, sales, computers, conversational English, dance, design, hospitality, housekeeping and crafts, conforms to students’ interests and talents.\r\n\r\nYoung women become independent, rather than mothers at the age of 13 or 14. Young men become responsible providers for their families.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure continuous participation in this program, each student receives a monthly stipend to help cover family expenses.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lhside\" src=\"http://sukrupa.localhost/content/krupaKids.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Outreach Program</h3>\r\nThis pilot project includes students from the SUKRUPA Youth Training Program. It teaches English to underprivileged urban slum and rural children studying in Kannada Government Schools from Class 1 to Class 7. The children participate in creative activities like art, craft, music, dance, games, and language practice. In 2009, over 400 children participated in this pilot project. We hope to expand it when funding becomes available.\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Community Development Program</h3>\r\nFor women and young adults in the community, particularly the parents and siblings of the children who attend SUKRUPA Education Center, the Community Development Program offers health camps, family counseling, parenting and life skills training as well as vocational training, that constitutes a foundation for dignified employment and self-sufficiency. The ultimate goal of this program is to provide a path out of the slums for relocation to mainstream neighborhoods.\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Rural Development Program</h3>\r\nThis pilot project addresses the challenges of rural poverty as the underlying cause for the formation of urban slums. SUKRUPA has established the project to include four villages in rural Bangalore. The program intends to provide pre-school activities, supplementary education for government school children and vocational training for young adults and older women. Future sources of revenue generation for the villages may include organic farming, dairy farming, and renewable energy.','What We Do','Our mission is to help deprived children and young adults escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy, and ignorance thereby creating opportunities for their integration into mainstream society.','publish','open','open','','activities','','','2011-02-21 15:44:29','2011-02-21 15:44:29','',0,'http://sukrupa.localhost/?page_id=14',0,'page','',0);

Nagar, Bangalore, providing a safe, caring, and clean environment for the children to live and learn in while their parents work.\n<h1>Our Programs</h1>\nWe holistically nurture the children and community by providing:\n<ul class=\"lined\">\n	<li>Free Schooling, from pre school through Class 10</li>\n	<li>Youth Training in life skills and distant learning</li>\n	<li>Community and Rural Development</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Residential Program</h3>\nThe SUKRUPA residential program runs a stable, full-time home for up to 10 children. In this loving family environment, children who are orphaned, have single parents or come from families in crisis receive affection, nutrition and guidance. They are provided schooling, education, health care and nutrition, discipline, and mentoring so that they develop as any other child would.\n<div class=\"subarea lhside\" style=\"width: 275px;\">\n<h2>Why It Matters</h2>\nChildren at SUKRUPA come from urban slum communities around Bangalore and are mostly first generation learners.\n\nMany of them come from families whose monthly income is less than Rs. 2,000, which is <strong>less than $50.00</strong>. This leads to a lack of basic needs – like education, health care, and nutrition – and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty.\n\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in their communities.\n\n</div>\n<h3>Sukrupa Education Center</h3>\nSUKRUPA Education Centre currently provides free schooling, nutritious food and basic health care to a population of over 400 children who thrive in a clean, safe, friendly and happy environment.\n\n<em>Student Eligibility and Parent Involvement</em>\nSUKRUPA conducts a strict screening process including home visits to determine below of poverty line status and requires a 14 to 16 year commitment of attendance. At the time of admission the parent makes an agreement with SUKRUPA to observe all rules and regulations and to attend child development training sessions every three months. Individual counseling is available per need.\n\n<em>The Curriculum</em>\nThe integrated curriculum at SUKRUPA is distinguished particularly by its emphasis on teaching the arts, social values and right attitude, in addition to academics as essential to a balanced education that produces young adults who are fiscally independent and personally responsible.\n\nSchool activities include:\n<ul class=\"lined\">\n	<li>Academics: Both innovative and traditional teaching methods</li>\n	<li>Languages: English, Kannada, Hindi, German and French</li>\n	<li>Fine Arts</li>\n	<li>Crafts</li>\n	<li>Theater</li>\n	<li>Indian and Western Classical Music and Dance</li>\n	<li>Sports</li>\n	<li>Club Projects in English, Math, Science, Geography, Sports and Horticulture</li>\n	<li>Field Trips</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SUKRUPA Youth Training Program</h3>\nFor older children and teens who have been child laborers or school drop-outs, the SUKRUPA Youth Training Program is a five year curriculum in personal life skills, social skills, leadership and academics studied through distance learning, provided by the state university.\n\nPractical training in teaching, accounting, sales, computers, conversational English, dance, design, hospitality, housekeeping and crafts, conforms to students’ interests and talents.\n\nYoung women become independent, rather than mothers at the age of 13 or 14. Young men become responsible providers for their families.\n\nIn order to insure continuous participation in this program, each student receives a monthly stipend to help cover family expenses.\n\n<img class=\"lhside\" src=\"http://sukrupa.localhost/content/krupaKids.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />\n<h3>SUKRUPA Outreach Program</h3>\nThis pilot project includes students from the SUKRUPA Youth Training Program. It teaches English to underprivileged urban slum and rural children studying in Kannada Government Schools from Class 1 to Class 7. The children participate in creative activities like art, craft, music, dance, games, and language practice. In 2009, over 400 children participated in this pilot project. We hope to expand it when funding becomes available.\n<h3>SUKRUPA Community Development Program</h3>\nFor women and young adults in the community, particularly the parents and siblings of the children who attend SUKRUPA Education Center, the Community Development Program offers health camps, family counseling, parenting and life skills training as well as vocational training, that constitutes a foundation for dignified employment and self-sufficiency. The ultimate goal of this program is to provide a path out of the slums for relocation to mainstream neighborhoods.\n<h3>SUKRUPA Rural Development Program</h3>\nThis pilot project addresses the challenges of rural poverty as the underlying cause for the formation of urban slums. SUKRUPA has established the project to include four villages in rural Bangalore. The program intends to provide pre-school activities, supplementary education for government school children and vocational training for young adults and older women. Future sources of revenue generation for the villages may include organic farming, dairy farming, and renewable energy.','What We Do','Our mission is to help deprived children and young adults escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy, and ignorance thereby creating opportunities for their integration into mainstream society.','inherit','open','open','','14-autosave','','','2011-02-21 15:42:51','2011-02-21 15:42:51','',14,'http://sukrupa.localhost/uncategorized/14-autosave/',0,'revision','',0);

Nagar, Bangalore and creates a safe, caring, and clean environment for the children to live and learn in while their parents work.\r\n\r\n<h3>Where We Work</h3>\r\nChildren at SUKRUPA come from urban slum communities around Bangalore. Many of them come from families whose monthly income is less than Rs. 2,000, which is less than $50.00. This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. As a result, the children start working or aimlessly loiter on the streets. Deprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in the community.\r\n\r\n<h3>Our Programs</h3>\r\nWe holistically nurture our children and provide:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Nutritious food each day</li>\r\n	<li>Academic instruction in day school and after school programs</li>\r\n	<li>Health care</li>\r\n	<li>Skills training</li>\r\n	<li>Opportunities to participate in sports and other recreational activities</li>\r\n	<li>Cultural opportunities and awareness</li>\r\n	<li>Training by professionals in dance, music and visual arts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>Residential Program</strong>\r\nA loving home and care is given for the neediest children, who are orphans, have single parents, or come from battered families. They are provided schooling, education, health care and nutrition, discipline, and mentoring so that they develop as any other child would.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sukrupa School</strong>\r\nSUKRUPA has taken the responsibility of nurturing, educating, and mentoring these children, while taking into account their backgrounds and that their parents: Oftentimes the children are first-generation learners, and their parents often do not have the time, resources, or the awareness to support the growth and development of the children fully &ndash; sadly they may not even understand its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n<em>Vision</em>\r\nWith the available resources and premises, a high standard curriculum is taught that is both creative and traditional so that children learn with understanding through engagement and personal development. SUKRUPA’s School program provides a quality education that enhances the children’s natural abilities and talents. The program gives them opportunities to realize their dreams and guides them to be independent and responsible people with good values.\r\n \r\n<strong>SUKRUPA Youth Program</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>School Retention</em>\r\nAs the children come from vulnerable backgrounds, we consider it a blessing that the parents have allowed them to continue in school instead of sending them to work as construction or domestic workers. Still, some of the girls do support the family by doing domestic work early in the morning and boys distribute papers or clean cars as the family has huge loans to pay. We are proud that the school dropout rate of children in our development program has dropped from 80% to 5% over the past few years.\r\n\r\n<em>Skills and Leadership Training</em>\r\nAs the community does not value skills training, many people do almost anything that pays money. Most of them are unskilled labors and do not have regular jobs. SUKRUPA has designed a special Life Skills Leadership Program for the 10th, 11th and 12th standard children. The first batch of 18 children participated in this program during the 2008-2009 academic year.\r\n\r\n<em>Building Community</em>\r\nSome of the children are part of a hockey program and the PRAYAAS dance group that requires them to practice on a regular basis. Others pitch in and help at SUKRUPA in teaching, accounting, sales, and designing for which they are provided special training. This assists them with employment at SUKRUPA while they continue their studies through long-distance education programs such as IGNOU till they complete their graduation. During this period they are given a small remuneration that encourages them to stay in school as well as teaching the value of saving.\r\n\r\nThis would mean five years or more for the 10th standard children and three years or more for the 12th standard children. The challenge is how to keep them until such time that they finish their graduation and how to employ them skillfully in various activities at SUKRUPA. If they are not monitored at this stage, the chances of their developing bad habits is at a maximum. As such, parents do not have the time or the know-how, the children themselves are still impressionable, and we feel strongly that it is important to guide these children for three or more years so that they develop deep roots in responsibility and accountability for themselves, for their families, and for the community.\r\n  \r\nWe consider the children at SUKRUPA as our own. We want to provide them the best for their growth in leadership and life skills. Grooming and mentoring them in the right direction is SUKRUPA’s mission and responsibility. Once they finish their graduation they can either continue working at SUKRUPA and take up leadership positions or they are free to work in any other field of their choice. Through this program we at SUKRUPA are confident that we offer a comprehensive program that gives the children a firm foundation that is the basis of a beautiful future.\r\n\r\n<em>Sports & Recreation</em>\r\nChildren are encouraged to participate in sports and various forms of adventure activities. Through different volunteer groups, children are able to play cricket, football, kabbadi, khokho, baseball, to name a few. SUKRUPA conducts competitive annual sports for all the children, and 6 of SUKRUPA boys play field hockey. They are trained at “Dhanraj Ballal Hockey Academy” through our partners at Dream a Dream.\r\n\r\nSUKRUPA also conducts several field trips annually which are both recreational and educational.\r\n\r\n<em>Creative Arts & Crafts</em>\r\nSUKRUPA believes that it is extremely important for the children to be creative for their overall development. Children have the opportunity to learn various arts including classical music, classical dance, free-style dance, drawing, painting, sketching, collage, glass painting, pottery painting, and mural work. Some of the artwork has been made into greeting cards as well. If a child is extraordinary in any art field or has specific talent, special attention is given and s/he is trained under professionals to pursue the specific art. \r\n\r\n<em>Prayaas Performing Group</em>\r\nPRAYAAS is an emerging performing group of SUKRUPA. The group can perform Bharatanatyam, Katak, Contemporary Classical, Freestyle,  Bollywood and Folk Dance. 50% of the revenue generated from the performance is distributed as scholarships among the children who perform, and the other 50% goes into the developmental programs of SUKRUPA.\r\n\r\nThis is a great incentive for the children, considering that most of them are school dropouts who are inducted back into school through our after-school program. Enormous effort and resources go into training them through professional artists in different forms of dance, music, and theatre.

Many of them come from families whose monthly income is less than Rs. 2,000, which is less than $50.00. This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. As a result, the children start working or aimlessly loiter on the streets. Deprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in the community.\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>Sukrupa School</strong>\r\nSUKRUPA has taken the responsibility of nurturing, educating, and mentoring these children, while taking into account their backgrounds and that their parents: Oftentimes the children are first-generation learners, and their parents often do not have the time, resources, or the awareness to support the growth and development of the children fully &ndash; sadly they may not even understand its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n<em>Vision</em>\r\nWith the available resources and premises, a high standard curriculum is taught that is both creative and traditional so that children learn with understanding through engagement and personal development. SUKRUPA’s School program provides a quality education that enhances the children’s natural abilities and talents. The program gives them opportunities to realize their dreams and guides them to be independent and responsible people with good values.\r\n \r\n<strong>SUKRUPA Youth Program</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>School Retention</em>\r\nAs the children come from vulnerable backgrounds, we consider it a blessing that the parents have allowed them to continue in school instead of sending them to work as construction or domestic workers. Still, some of the girls do support the family by doing domestic work early in the morning and boys distribute papers or clean cars as the family has huge loans to pay. We are proud that the school dropout rate of children in our development program has dropped from 80% to 5% over the past few years.\r\n\r\n<em>Skills and Leadership Training</em>\r\nAs the community does not value skills training, many people do almost anything that pays money. Most of them are unskilled labors and do not have regular jobs. SUKRUPA has designed a special Life Skills Leadership Program for the 10th, 11th and 12th standard children. The first batch of 18 children participated in this program during the 2008-2009 academic year.\r\n\r\n<em>Building Community</em>\r\nSome of the children are part of a hockey program and the PRAYAAS dance group that requires them to practice on a regular basis. Others pitch in and help at SUKRUPA in teaching, accounting, sales, and designing for which they are provided special training. This assists them with employment at SUKRUPA while they continue their studies through long-distance education programs such as IGNOU till they complete their graduation. During this period they are given a small remuneration that encourages them to stay in school as well as teaching the value of saving.\r\n\r\nThis would mean five years or more for the 10th standard children and three years or more for the 12th standard children. The challenge is how to keep them until such time that they finish their graduation and how to employ them skillfully in various activities at SUKRUPA. If they are not monitored at this stage, the chances of their developing bad habits is at a maximum. As such, parents do not have the time or the know-how, the children themselves are still impressionable, and we feel strongly that it is important to guide these children for three or more years so that they develop deep roots in responsibility and accountability for themselves, for their families, and for the community.\r\n  \r\nWe consider the children at SUKRUPA as our own. We want to provide them the best for their growth in leadership and life skills. Grooming and mentoring them in the right direction is SUKRUPA’s mission and responsibility. Once they finish their graduation they can either continue working at SUKRUPA and take up leadership positions or they are free to work in any other field of their choice. Through this program we at SUKRUPA are confident that we offer a comprehensive program that gives the children a firm foundation that is the basis of a beautiful future.\r\n\r\n<em>Sports & Recreation</em>\r\nChildren are encouraged to participate in sports and various forms of adventure activities. Through different volunteer groups, children are able to play cricket, football, kabbadi, khokho, baseball, to name a few. SUKRUPA conducts competitive annual sports for all the children, and 6 of SUKRUPA boys play field hockey. They are trained at “Dhanraj Ballal Hockey Academy” through our partners at Dream a Dream.\r\n\r\nSUKRUPA also conducts several field trips annually which are both recreational and educational.\r\n\r\n<em>Creative Arts & Crafts</em>\r\nSUKRUPA believes that it is extremely important for the children to be creative for their overall development. Children have the opportunity to learn various arts including classical music, classical dance, free-style dance, drawing, painting, sketching, collage, glass painting, pottery painting, and mural work. Some of the artwork has been made into greeting cards as well. If a child is extraordinary in any art field or has specific talent, special attention is given and s/he is trained under professionals to pursue the specific art. \r\n\r\n<em>Prayaas Performing Group</em>\r\nPRAYAAS is an emerging performing group of SUKRUPA. The group can perform Bharatanatyam, Katak, Contemporary Classical, Freestyle,  Bollywood and Folk Dance. 50% of the revenue generated from the performance is distributed as scholarships among the children who perform, and the other 50% goes into the developmental programs of SUKRUPA.\r\n\r\nThis is a great incentive for the children, considering that most of them are school dropouts who are inducted back into school through our after-school program.

They are provided schooling, education, health care and nutrition, discipline, and mentoring so that they develop as any other child would.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"subarea lhside\">\r\n<img src=\"http://placehold.it/150x150\" class=\"lhside\" /><h2>Why It Matters</h2>\r\nChildren at SUKRUPA come from urban slum communities around Bangalore. Many of them come from families whose monthly income is less than Rs. 2,000, which is less than $50.00. This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. As a result, the children start working or aimlessly loiter on the streets. Deprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in the community.\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>Sukrupa School</strong>\r\nSUKRUPA has taken the responsibility of nurturing, educating, and mentoring these children, while taking into account their backgrounds and that their parents: Oftentimes the children are first-generation learners, and their parents often do not have the time, resources, or the awareness to support the growth and development of the children fully &ndash; sadly they may not even understand its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n<em>Vision</em>\r\nWith the available resources and premises, a high standard curriculum is taught that is both creative and traditional so that children learn with understanding through engagement and personal development. SUKRUPA’s School program provides a quality education that enhances the children’s natural abilities and talents. The program gives them opportunities to realize their dreams and guides them to be independent and responsible people with good values.\r\n \r\n<strong>SUKRUPA Youth Program</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>School Retention</em>\r\nAs the children come from vulnerable backgrounds, we consider it a blessing that the parents have allowed them to continue in school instead of sending them to work as construction or domestic workers. Still, some of the girls do support the family by doing domestic work early in the morning and boys distribute papers or clean cars as the family has huge loans to pay. We are proud that the school dropout rate of children in our development program has dropped from 80% to 5% over the past few years.\r\n\r\n<em>Skills and Leadership Training</em>\r\nAs the community does not value skills training, many people do almost anything that pays money. Most of them are unskilled labors and do not have regular jobs. SUKRUPA has designed a special Life Skills Leadership Program for the 10th, 11th and 12th standard children. The first batch of 18 children participated in this program during the 2008-2009 academic year.\r\n\r\n<em>Building Community</em>\r\nSome of the children are part of a hockey program and the PRAYAAS dance group that requires them to practice on a regular basis. Others pitch in and help at SUKRUPA in teaching, accounting, sales, and designing for which they are provided special training. This assists them with employment at SUKRUPA while they continue their studies through long-distance education programs such as IGNOU till they complete their graduation. During this period they are given a small remuneration that encourages them to stay in school as well as teaching the value of saving.\r\n\r\nThis would mean five years or more for the 10th standard children and three years or more for the 12th standard children. The challenge is how to keep them until such time that they finish their graduation and how to employ them skillfully in various activities at SUKRUPA. If they are not monitored at this stage, the chances of their developing bad habits is at a maximum. As such, parents do not have the time or the know-how, the children themselves are still impressionable, and we feel strongly that it is important to guide these children for three or more years so that they develop deep roots in responsibility and accountability for themselves, for their families, and for the community.\r\n  \r\nWe consider the children at SUKRUPA as our own. We want to provide them the best for their growth in leadership and life skills. Grooming and mentoring them in the right direction is SUKRUPA’s mission and responsibility. Once they finish their graduation they can either continue working at SUKRUPA and take up leadership positions or they are free to work in any other field of their choice. Through this program we at SUKRUPA are confident that we offer a comprehensive program that gives the children a firm foundation that is the basis of a beautiful future.\r\n\r\n<em>Sports & Recreation</em>\r\nChildren are encouraged to participate in sports and various forms of adventure activities. Through different volunteer groups, children are able to play cricket, football, kabbadi, khokho, baseball, to name a few. SUKRUPA conducts competitive annual sports for all the children, and 6 of SUKRUPA boys play field hockey. They are trained at “Dhanraj Ballal Hockey Academy” through our partners at Dream a Dream.\r\n\r\nSUKRUPA also conducts several field trips annually which are both recreational and educational.\r\n\r\n<em>Creative Arts & Crafts</em>\r\nSUKRUPA believes that it is extremely important for the children to be creative for their overall development. Children have the opportunity to learn various arts including classical music, classical dance, free-style dance, drawing, painting, sketching, collage, glass painting, pottery painting, and mural work. Some of the artwork has been made into greeting cards as well. If a child is extraordinary in any art field or has specific talent, special attention is given and s/he is trained under professionals to pursue the specific art. \r\n\r\n<em>Prayaas Performing Group</em>\r\nPRAYAAS is an emerging performing group of SUKRUPA. The group can perform Bharatanatyam, Katak, Contemporary Classical, Freestyle,  Bollywood and Folk Dance. 50% of the revenue generated from the performance is distributed as scholarships among the children who perform, and the other 50% goes into the developmental programs of SUKRUPA.\r\n\r\nThis is a great incentive for the children, considering that most of them are school dropouts who are inducted back into school through our after-school program. Enormous effort and resources go into training them through professional artists in different forms of dance, music, and theatre. The focus and skill is to spot the talents and create opportunities for the children to realize their dreams and grow as independent citizens.\r\n\r\n','What We Do','Our mission is to help underprivileged children escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy and ignorance, replacing these challenges with hope and opportunities available to mainstream children.

Nagar, Bangalore and creates a safe, caring, and clean environment for the children to live and learn in while their parents work.\r\n\r\n<h3>Our Programs</h3>\r\nWe holistically nurture our children and provide:\r\n<ul class=\"lined\">\r\n	<li>Nutritious food each day</li>\r\n	<li>Academic instruction in day school and after school programs</li>\r\n	<li>Health care</li>\r\n	<li>Skills training</li>\r\n	<li>Opportunities to participate in sports and other recreational activities</li>\r\n	<li>Cultural opportunities and awareness</li>\r\n	<li>Training by professionals in dance, music and visual arts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>Residential Program</strong>\r\nA loving home and care is given for the neediest children, who are orphans, have single parents, or come from battered families. They are provided schooling, education, health care and nutrition, discipline, and mentoring so that they develop as any other child would.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"subarea lhside\">\r\n<h2>Why It Matters</h2>\r\nChildren at SUKRUPA come from urban slum communities around Bangalore. \r\n\r\nMany of them come from families whose monthly income is less than Rs. 2,000, which is <strong>less than $50.00</strong>. This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. \r\n\r\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in their communities.\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>Sukrupa School</strong>\r\nSUKRUPA has taken the responsibility of nurturing, educating, and mentoring these children, while taking into account their backgrounds and that their parents: Oftentimes the children are first-generation learners, and their parents often do not have the time, resources, or the awareness to support the growth and development of the children fully &ndash; sadly they may not even understand its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n<em>Vision</em>\r\nWith the available resources and premises, a high standard curriculum is taught that is both creative and traditional so that children learn with understanding through engagement and personal development. SUKRUPA’s School program provides a quality education that enhances the children’s natural abilities and talents. The program gives them opportunities to realize their dreams and guides them to be independent and responsible people with good values.\r\n \r\n<strong>SUKRUPA Youth Program</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>School Retention</em>\r\nAs the children come from vulnerable backgrounds, we consider it a blessing that the parents have allowed them to continue in school instead of sending them to work as construction or domestic workers. Still, some of the girls do support the family by doing domestic work early in the morning and boys distribute papers or clean cars as the family has huge loans to pay. We are proud that the school dropout rate of children in our development program has dropped from 80% to 5% over the past few years.\r\n\r\n<em>Skills and Leadership Training</em>\r\nAs the community does not value skills training, many people do almost anything that pays money. Most of them are unskilled labors and do not have regular jobs. SUKRUPA has designed a special Life Skills Leadership Program for the 10th, 11th and 12th standard children. The first batch of 18 children participated in this program during the 2008-2009 academic year.\r\n\r\n<em>Building Community</em>\r\nSome of the children are part of a hockey program and the PRAYAAS dance group that requires them to practice on a regular basis. Others pitch in and help at SUKRUPA in teaching, accounting, sales, and designing for which they are provided special training. This assists them with employment at SUKRUPA while they continue their studies through long-distance education programs such as IGNOU till they complete their graduation. During this period they are given a small remuneration that encourages them to stay in school as well as teaching the value of saving.\r\n\r\nThis would mean five years or more for the 10th standard children and three years or more for the 12th standard children. The challenge is how to keep them until such time that they finish their graduation and how to employ them skillfully in various activities at SUKRUPA. If they are not monitored at this stage, the chances of their developing bad habits is at a maximum. As such, parents do not have the time or the know-how, the children themselves are still impressionable, and we feel strongly that it is important to guide these children for three or more years so that they develop deep roots in responsibility and accountability for themselves, for their families, and for the community.\r\n  \r\nWe consider the children at SUKRUPA as our own. We want to provide them the best for their growth in leadership and life skills. Grooming and mentoring them in the right direction is SUKRUPA’s mission and responsibility. Once they finish their graduation they can either continue working at SUKRUPA and take up leadership positions or they are free to work in any other field of their choice. Through this program we at SUKRUPA are confident that we offer a comprehensive program that gives the children a firm foundation that is the basis of a beautiful future.\r\n\r\n<em>Sports & Recreation</em>\r\nChildren are encouraged to participate in sports and various forms of adventure activities. Through different volunteer groups, children are able to play cricket, football, kabbadi, khokho, baseball, to name a few. SUKRUPA conducts competitive annual sports for all the children, and 6 of SUKRUPA boys play field hockey. They are trained at “Dhanraj Ballal Hockey Academy” through our partners at Dream a Dream.\r\n\r\nSUKRUPA also conducts several field trips annually which are both recreational and educational.\r\n\r\n<em>Creative Arts & Crafts</em>\r\nSUKRUPA believes that it is extremely important for the children to be creative for their overall development. Children have the opportunity to learn various arts including classical music, classical dance, free-style dance, drawing, painting, sketching, collage, glass painting, pottery painting, and mural work. Some of the artwork has been made into greeting cards as well. If a child is extraordinary in any art field or has specific talent, special attention is given and s/he is trained under professionals to pursue the specific art. \r\n\r\n<em>Prayaas Performing Group</em>\r\nPRAYAAS is an emerging performing group of SUKRUPA. The group can perform Bharatanatyam, Katak, Contemporary Classical, Freestyle,  Bollywood and Folk Dance. 50% of the revenue generated from the performance is distributed as scholarships among the children who perform, and the other 50% goes into the developmental programs of SUKRUPA.\r\n\r\nThis is a great incentive for the children, considering that most of them are school dropouts who are inducted back into school through our after-school program. Enormous effort and resources go into training them through professional artists in different forms of dance, music, and theatre. The focus and skill is to spot the talents and create opportunities for the children to realize their dreams and grow as independent citizens.\r\n\r\n','What We Do','Our mission is to help underprivileged children escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy and ignorance, replacing these challenges with hope and opportunities available to mainstream children.

We want to provide them the best for their growth in leadership and life skills. Grooming and mentoring them in the right direction is SUKRUPA’s mission and responsibility. Once they finish their graduation they can either continue working at SUKRUPA and take up leadership positions or they are free to work in any other field of their choice. Through this program we at SUKRUPA are confident that we offer a comprehensive program that gives the children a firm foundation that is the basis of a beautiful future.\r\n\r\n<em>Sports & Recreation</em>\r\nChildren are encouraged to participate in sports and various forms of adventure activities. Through different volunteer groups, children are able to play cricket, football, kabbadi, khokho, baseball, to name a few. SUKRUPA conducts competitive annual sports for all the children, and 6 of SUKRUPA boys play field hockey. They are trained at “Dhanraj Ballal Hockey Academy” through our partners at Dream a Dream.\r\n\r\nSUKRUPA also conducts several field trips annually which are both recreational and educational.\r\n\r\n<em>Creative Arts & Crafts</em>\r\nSUKRUPA believes that it is extremely important for the children to be creative for their overall development. Children have the opportunity to learn various arts including classical music, classical dance, free-style dance, drawing, painting, sketching, collage, glass painting, pottery painting, and mural work. Some of the artwork has been made into greeting cards as well. If a child is extraordinary in any art field or has specific talent, special attention is given and s/he is trained under professionals to pursue the specific art. \r\n\r\n<em>Prayaas Performing Group</em>\r\nPRAYAAS is an emerging performing group of SUKRUPA. The group can perform Bharatanatyam, Katak, Contemporary Classical, Freestyle,  Bollywood and Folk Dance. 50% of the revenue generated from the performance is distributed as scholarships among the children who perform, and the other 50% goes into the developmental programs of SUKRUPA.\r\n\r\nThis is a great incentive for the children, considering that most of them are school dropouts who are inducted back into school through our after-school program. Enormous effort and resources go into training them through professional artists in different forms of dance, music, and theatre. The focus and skill is to spot the talents and create opportunities for the children to realize their dreams and grow as independent citizens.\r\n\r\n','What We Do','Our mission is to help underprivileged children escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy and ignorance, replacing these challenges with hope and opportunities available to mainstream children.

This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. \r\n\r\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in their communities.\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>Sukrupa School</strong>\r\nSUKRUPA has taken the responsibility of nurturing, educating, and mentoring these children, while taking into account their backgrounds and that their parents: Oftentimes the children are first-generation learners, and their parents often do not have the time, resources, or the awareness to support the growth and development of the children fully &ndash; sadly they may not even understand its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n<em>Vision</em>\r\nWith the available resources and premises, a high standard curriculum is taught that is both creative and traditional so that children learn with understanding through engagement and personal development. SUKRUPA’s School program provides a quality education that enhances the children’s natural abilities and talents. The program gives them opportunities to realize their dreams and guides them to be independent and responsible people with good values.\r\n \r\n<strong>SUKRUPA Youth Program</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>School Retention</em>\r\nAs the children come from vulnerable backgrounds, we consider it a blessing that the parents have allowed them to continue in school instead of sending them to work as construction or domestic workers. Still, some of the girls do support the family by doing domestic work early in the morning and boys distribute papers or clean cars as the family has huge loans to pay. We are proud that the school dropout rate of children in our development program has dropped from 80% to 5% over the past few years.\r\n\r\n<em>Skills and Leadership Training</em>\r\nAs the community does not value skills training, many people do almost anything that pays money. Most of them are unskilled labors and do not have regular jobs. SUKRUPA has designed a special Life Skills Leadership Program for the 10th, 11th and 12th standard children. The first batch of 18 children participated in this program during the 2008-2009 academic year.\r\n\r\n<em>Building Community</em>\r\nSome of the children are part of a hockey program and the PRAYAAS dance group that requires them to practice on a regular basis. Others pitch in and help at SUKRUPA in teaching, accounting, sales, and designing for which they are provided special training. This assists them with employment at SUKRUPA while they continue their studies through long-distance education programs such as IGNOU till they complete their graduation. During this period they are given a small remuneration that encourages them to stay in school as well as teaching the value of saving.\r\n\r\nThis would mean five years or more for the 10th standard children and three years or more for the 12th standard children. The challenge is how to keep them until such time that they finish their graduation and how to employ them skillfully in various activities at SUKRUPA.

This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. \r\n\r\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in their communities.\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Sukrupa School</h3>\r\nSUKRUPA has taken the responsibility of nurturing, educating, and mentoring these children, while taking into account their backgrounds and that their parents: Oftentimes the children are first-generation learners, and their parents often do not have the time, resources, or the awareness to support the growth and development of the children fully &ndash; sadly they may not even understand its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n<em>Vision</em>\r\nWith the available resources and premises, a high standard curriculum is taught that is both creative and traditional so that children learn with understanding through engagement and personal development. SUKRUPA’s School program provides a quality education that enhances the children’s natural abilities and talents. The program gives them opportunities to realize their dreams and guides them to be independent and responsible people with good values.\r\n \r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Youth Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<em>School Retention</em>\r\nAs the children come from vulnerable backgrounds, we consider it a blessing that the parents have allowed them to continue in school instead of sending them to work as construction or domestic workers. Still, some of the girls do support the family by doing domestic work early in the morning and boys distribute papers or clean cars as the family has huge loans to pay. We are proud that the school dropout rate of children in our development program has dropped from 80% to 5% over the past few years.\r\n\r\n<em>Skills and Leadership Training</em>\r\nAs the community does not value skills training, many people do almost anything that pays money. Most of them are unskilled labors and do not have regular jobs. SUKRUPA has designed a special Life Skills Leadership Program for the 10th, 11th and 12th standard children. The first batch of 18 children participated in this program during the 2008-2009 academic year.\r\n\r\n<em>Building Community</em>\r\nSome of the children are part of a hockey program and the PRAYAAS dance group that requires them to practice on a regular basis. Others pitch in and help at SUKRUPA in teaching, accounting, sales, and designing for which they are provided special training. This assists them with employment at SUKRUPA while they continue their studies through long-distance education programs such as IGNOU till they complete their graduation. During this period they are given a small remuneration that encourages them to stay in school as well as teaching the value of saving.\r\n\r\nThis would mean five years or more for the 10th standard children and three years or more for the 12th standard children. The challenge is how to keep them until such time that they finish their graduation and how to employ them skillfully in various activities at SUKRUPA. If they are not monitored at this stage, the chances of their developing bad habits is at a maximum. As such, parents do not have the time or the know-how, the children themselves are still impressionable, and we feel strongly that it is important to guide these children for three or more years so that they develop deep roots in responsibility and accountability for themselves, for their families, and for the community.\r\n  \r\nWe consider the children at SUKRUPA as our own. We want to provide them the best for their growth in leadership and life skills. Grooming and mentoring them in the right direction is SUKRUPA’s mission and responsibility. Once they finish their graduation they can either continue working at SUKRUPA and take up leadership positions or they are free to work in any other field of their choice. Through this program we at SUKRUPA are confident that we offer a comprehensive program that gives the children a firm foundation that is the basis of a beautiful future.\r\n\r\n<em>Sports & Recreation</em>\r\nChildren are encouraged to participate in sports and various forms of adventure activities. Through different volunteer groups, children are able to play cricket, football, kabbadi, khokho, baseball, to name a few. SUKRUPA conducts competitive annual sports for all the children, and 6 of SUKRUPA boys play field hockey. They are trained at “Dhanraj Ballal Hockey Academy” through our partners at Dream a Dream.\r\n\r\nSUKRUPA also conducts several field trips annually which are both recreational and educational.\r\n\r\n<em>Creative Arts & Crafts</em>\r\nSUKRUPA believes that it is extremely important for the children to be creative for their overall development.

They are provided schooling, education, health care and nutrition, discipline, and mentoring so that they develop as any other child would.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"subarea lhside\" style=\"width:275px\">\r\n<h2>Why It Matters</h2>\r\nChildren at SUKRUPA come from urban slum communities around Bangalore. \r\n\r\nMany of them come from families whose monthly income is less than Rs. 2,000, which is <strong>less than $50.00</strong>. This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. \r\n\r\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in their communities.\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Sukrupa School</h3>\r\nSUKRUPA has taken the responsibility of nurturing, educating, and mentoring these children, while taking into account their backgrounds and that their parents: Oftentimes the children are first-generation learners, and their parents often do not have the time, resources, or the awareness to support the growth and development of the children fully &ndash; sadly they may not even understand its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n<em>Vision</em>\r\nWith the available resources and premises, a high standard curriculum is taught that is both creative and traditional so that children learn with understanding through engagement and personal development. SUKRUPA’s School program provides a quality education that enhances the children’s natural abilities and talents. The program gives them opportunities to realize their dreams and guides them to be independent and responsible people with good values.\r\n \r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Youth Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<em>School Retention</em>\r\nAs the children come from vulnerable backgrounds, we consider it a blessing that the parents have allowed them to continue in school instead of sending them to work as construction or domestic workers. Still, some of the girls do support the family by doing domestic work early in the morning and boys distribute papers or clean cars as the family has huge loans to pay. We are proud that the school dropout rate of children in our development program has dropped from 80% to 5% over the past few years.\r\n\r\n<em>Skills and Leadership Training</em>\r\nAs the community does not value skills training, many people do almost anything that pays money. Most of them are unskilled labors and do not have regular jobs. SUKRUPA has designed a special Life Skills Leadership Program for the 10th, 11th and 12th standard children. The first batch of 18 children participated in this program during the 2008-2009 academic year.\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://sukrupa.localhost/content/krupaKids.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"lhside\" /></p><em>Building Community</em>\r\nSome of the children are part of a hockey program and the PRAYAAS dance group that requires them to practice on a regular basis. Others pitch in and help at SUKRUPA in teaching, accounting, sales, and designing for which they are provided special training. This assists them with employment at SUKRUPA while they continue their studies through long-distance education programs such as IGNOU till they complete their graduation. During this period they are given a small remuneration that encourages them to stay in school as well as teaching the value of saving.\r\n\r\nThis would mean five years or more for the 10th standard children and three years or more for the 12th standard children. The challenge is how to keep them until such time that they finish their graduation and how to employ them skillfully in various activities at SUKRUPA. If they are not monitored at this stage, the chances of their developing bad habits is at a maximum. As such, parents do not have the time or the know-how, the children themselves are still impressionable, and we feel strongly that it is important to guide these children for three or more years so that they develop deep roots in responsibility and accountability for themselves, for their families, and for the community.\r\n  \r\nWe consider the children at SUKRUPA as our own. We want to provide them the best for their growth in leadership and life skills. Grooming and mentoring them in the right direction is SUKRUPA’s mission and responsibility. Once they finish their graduation they can either continue working at SUKRUPA and take up leadership positions or they are free to work in any other field of their choice. Through this program we at SUKRUPA are confident that we offer a comprehensive program that gives the children a firm foundation that is the basis of a beautiful future.\r\n\r\n<em>Sports & Recreation</em>\r\nChildren are encouraged to participate in sports and various forms of adventure activities. Through different volunteer groups, children are able to play cricket, football, kabbadi, khokho, baseball, to name a few. SUKRUPA conducts competitive annual sports for all the children, and 6 of SUKRUPA boys play field hockey. They are trained at “Dhanraj Ballal Hockey Academy” through our partners at Dream a Dream.\r\n\r\nSUKRUPA also conducts several field trips annually which are both recreational and educational.\r\n\r\n<em>Creative Arts & Crafts</em>\r\nSUKRUPA believes that it is extremely important for the children to be creative for their overall development. Children have the opportunity to learn various arts including classical music, classical dance, free-style dance, drawing, painting, sketching, collage, glass painting, pottery painting, and mural work. Some of the artwork has been made into greeting cards as well. If a child is extraordinary in any art field or has specific talent, special attention is given and s/he is trained under professionals to pursue the specific art. \r\n\r\n<em>Prayaas Performing Group</em>\r\nPRAYAAS is an emerging performing group of SUKRUPA. The group can perform Bharatanatyam, Katak, Contemporary Classical, Freestyle,  Bollywood and Folk Dance. 50% of the revenue generated from the performance is distributed as scholarships among the children who perform, and the other 50% goes into the developmental programs of SUKRUPA.\r\n\r\nThis is a great incentive for the children, considering that most of them are school dropouts who are inducted back into school through our after-school program. Enormous effort and resources go into training them through professional artists in different forms of dance, music, and theatre. The focus and skill is to spot the talents and create opportunities for the children to realize their dreams and grow as independent citizens.\r\n\r\n','What We Do','Our mission is to help underprivileged children escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy and ignorance, replacing these challenges with hope and the opportunities available to mainstream children.

Nagar, Bangalore and creates a safe, caring, and clean environment for the children to live and learn in while their parents work.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h1>Our Programs</h1>\r\nWe holistically nurture our children and provide:\r\n<ul class=\"lined\">\r\n	<li>Nutritious food each day</li>\r\n	<li>Academic instruction in day school and after school programs</li>\r\n	<li>Health care</li>\r\n	<li>Skills training</li>\r\n	<li>Opportunities to participate in sports and other recreational activities</li>\r\n	<li>Cultural opportunities and awareness</li>\r\n	<li>Training by professionals in dance, music and visual arts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Residential Program</h3>\r\nA loving home and care is given for the neediest children, who are orphans, have single parents, or come from battered families. They are provided schooling, education, health care and nutrition, discipline, and mentoring so that they develop as any other child would.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"subarea lhside\" style=\"width:275px\">\r\n<h2>Why It Matters</h2>\r\nChildren at SUKRUPA come from urban slum communities around Bangalore. \r\n\r\nMany of them come from families whose monthly income is less than Rs. 2,000, which is <strong>less than $50.00</strong>. This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. \r\n\r\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in their communities.\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Sukrupa School</h3>\r\nSUKRUPA has taken the responsibility of nurturing, educating, and mentoring these children, while taking into account their backgrounds and that their parents: Oftentimes the children are first-generation learners, and their parents often do not have the time, resources, or the awareness to support the growth and development of the children fully &ndash; sadly they may not even understand its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n<em>Vision</em>\r\nWith the available resources and premises, a high standard curriculum is taught that is both creative and traditional so that children learn with understanding through engagement and personal development. SUKRUPA’s School program provides a quality education that enhances the children’s natural abilities and talents. The program gives them opportunities to realize their dreams and guides them to be independent and responsible people with good values.\r\n \r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Youth Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<em>School Retention</em>\r\nAs the children come from vulnerable backgrounds, we consider it a blessing that the parents have allowed them to continue in school instead of sending them to work as construction or domestic workers. Still, some of the girls do support the family by doing domestic work early in the morning and boys distribute papers or clean cars as the family has huge loans to pay. We are proud that the school dropout rate of children in our development program has dropped from 80% to 5% over the past few years.\r\n\r\n<em>Skills and Leadership Training</em>\r\nAs the community does not value skills training, many people do almost anything that pays money. Most of them are unskilled labors and do not have regular jobs. SUKRUPA has designed a special Life Skills Leadership Program for the 10th, 11th and 12th standard children. The first batch of 18 children participated in this program during the 2008-2009 academic year.\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://sukrupa.localhost/content/krupaKids.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"lhside\" /></p><em>Building Community</em>\r\nSome of the children are part of a hockey program and the PRAYAAS dance group that requires them to practice on a regular basis. Others pitch in and help at SUKRUPA in teaching, accounting, sales, and designing for which they are provided special training. This assists them with employment at SUKRUPA while they continue their studies through long-distance education programs such as IGNOU till they complete their graduation. During this period they are given a small remuneration that encourages them to stay in school as well as teaching the value of saving.\r\n\r\nThis would mean five years or more for the 10th standard children and three years or more for the 12th standard children. The challenge is how to keep them until such time that they finish their graduation and how to employ them skillfully in various activities at SUKRUPA. If they are not monitored at this stage, the chances of their developing bad habits is at a maximum. As such, parents do not have the time or the know-how, the children themselves are still impressionable, and we feel strongly that it is important to guide these children for three or more years so that they develop deep roots in responsibility and accountability for themselves, for their families, and for the community.\r\n  \r\nWe consider the children at SUKRUPA as our own. We want to provide them the best for their growth in leadership and life skills. Grooming and mentoring them in the right direction is SUKRUPA’s mission and responsibility. Once they finish their graduation they can either continue working at SUKRUPA and take up leadership positions or they are free to work in any other field of their choice. Through this program we at SUKRUPA are confident that we offer a comprehensive program that gives the children a firm foundation that is the basis of a beautiful future.\r\n\r\n<em>Sports & Recreation</em>\r\nChildren are encouraged to participate in sports and various forms of adventure activities. Through different volunteer groups, children are able to play cricket, football, kabbadi, khokho, baseball, to name a few. SUKRUPA conducts competitive annual sports for all the children, and 6 of SUKRUPA boys play field hockey. They are trained at “Dhanraj Ballal Hockey Academy” through our partners at Dream a Dream.\r\n\r\nSUKRUPA also conducts several field trips annually which are both recreational and educational.\r\n\r\n<em>Creative Arts & Crafts</em>\r\nSUKRUPA believes that it is extremely important for the children to be creative for their overall development. Children have the opportunity to learn various arts including classical music, classical dance, free-style dance, drawing, painting, sketching, collage, glass painting, pottery painting, and mural work. Some of the artwork has been made into greeting cards as well. If a child is extraordinary in any art field or has specific talent, special attention is given and s/he is trained under professionals to pursue the specific art. \r\n\r\n<em>Prayaas Performing Group</em>\r\nPRAYAAS is an emerging performing group of SUKRUPA. The group can perform Bharatanatyam, Katak, Contemporary Classical, Freestyle,  Bollywood and Folk Dance. 50% of the revenue generated from the performance is distributed as scholarships among the children who perform, and the other 50% goes into the developmental programs of SUKRUPA.\r\n\r\nThis is a great incentive for the children, considering that most of them are school dropouts who are inducted back into school through our after-school program. Enormous effort and resources go into training them through professional artists in different forms of dance, music, and theatre. The focus and skill is to spot the talents and create opportunities for the children to realize their dreams and grow as independent citizens.\r\n\r\n','What We Do','Our mission is to help underprivileged children escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy and ignorance, replacing these challenges with hope and the opportunities available to mainstream children.

First with eight kids, she taught all subjects as an after school program. By 1981, she was teaching 150 children, as they spilled out into the yard. Her daughter Krupa and son Sathya grew up in this environment, and they would teach students in the grade below them. Sathya went on to become a software professional, and Krupa became a successful entrepreneur. By 2001, her pursuits led her through India, Italy, Brazil, Japan, Malaysia, Srilanka, and Indonesia into the granite industry in the United States. This history combined a fundamental belief in the importance of education and a global perspective on the social problems of India. \r\n\r\nOut of a passion to create opportunities for deprived children, Krupa ended her lucrative career in the United States after a four-week vacation to India during summer of 2002. She setup SUKRUPA and then in 2008, created the social enterprise SUKRUPA Creations, which employs the children\'s parents.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"subarea lhside\">\r\n<h2>Our People</h2>\r\nThe Board consists of highly successful professionals, with a vision and passion to work with underprivileged children.

This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. \r\n\r\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in their communities.\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Sukrupa School</h3>\r\nSUKRUPA has taken the responsibility of nurturing, educating, and mentoring these children, while taking into account their backgrounds and that their parents: Oftentimes the children are first-generation learners, and their parents often do not have the time, resources, or the awareness to support the growth and development of the children fully &ndash; sadly they may not even understand its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n<em>Vision</em>\r\nWith the available resources and premises, a high standard curriculum is taught that is both creative and traditional so that children learn with understanding through engagement and personal development. SUKRUPA’s School program provides a quality education that enhances the children’s natural abilities and talents. The program gives them opportunities to realize their dreams and guides them to be independent and responsible people with good values.\r\n \r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Youth Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<em>School Retention</em>\r\nAs the children come from vulnerable backgrounds, we consider it a blessing that the parents have allowed them to continue in school instead of sending them to work as construction or domestic workers. Still, some of the girls do support the family by doing domestic work early in the morning and boys distribute papers or clean cars as the family has huge loans to pay. We are proud that the school dropout rate of children in our development program has dropped from 80% to 5% over the past few years.\r\n\r\n<em>Skills and Leadership Training</em>\r\nAs the community does not value skills training, many people do almost anything that pays money. Most of them are unskilled labors and do not have regular jobs. SUKRUPA has designed a special Life Skills Leadership Program for the 10th, 11th and 12th standard children. The first batch of 18 children participated in this program during the 2008-2009 academic year.\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://sukrupa.localhost/content/krupaKids.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"lhside\" /></p><em>Building Community</em>\r\nSome of the children are part of a hockey program and the PRAYAAS dance group that requires them to practice on a regular basis. Others pitch in and help at SUKRUPA in teaching, accounting, sales, and designing for which they are provided special training. This assists them with employment at SUKRUPA while they continue their studies through long-distance education programs such as IGNOU till they complete their graduation. During this period they are given a small remuneration that encourages them to stay in school as well as teaching the value of saving.\r\n\r\nThis would mean five years or more for the 10th standard children and three years or more for the 12th standard children. The challenge is how to keep them until such time that they finish their graduation and how to employ them skillfully in various activities at SUKRUPA. If they are not monitored at this stage, the chances of their developing bad habits is at a maximum. As such, parents do not have the time or the know-how, the children themselves are still impressionable, and we feel strongly that it is important to guide these children for three or more years so that they develop deep roots in responsibility and accountability for themselves, for their families, and for the community.\r\n  \r\nWe consider the children at SUKRUPA as our own. We want to provide them the best for their growth in leadership and life skills. Grooming and mentoring them in the right direction is SUKRUPA’s mission and responsibility. Once they finish their graduation they can either continue working at SUKRUPA and take up leadership positions or they are free to work in any other field of their choice. Through this program we at SUKRUPA are confident that we offer a comprehensive program that gives the children a firm foundation that is the basis of a beautiful future.\r\n\r\n<em>Sports & Recreation</em>\r\nChildren are encouraged to participate in sports and various forms of adventure activities. Through different volunteer groups, children are able to play cricket, football, kabbadi, khokho, baseball, to name a few. SUKRUPA conducts competitive annual sports for all the children, and 6 of SUKRUPA boys play field hockey. They are trained at “Dhanraj Ballal Hockey Academy” through our partners at Dream a Dream.\r\n\r\nSUKRUPA also conducts several field trips annually which are both recreational and educational.\r\n\r\n<em>Creative Arts & Crafts</em>\r\nSUKRUPA believes that it is extremely important for the children to be creative for their overall development. Children have the opportunity to learn various arts including classical music, classical dance, free-style dance, drawing, painting, sketching, collage, glass painting, pottery painting, and mural work. Some of the artwork has been made into greeting cards as well. If a child is extraordinary in any art field or has specific talent, special attention is given and s/he is trained under professionals to pursue the specific art. \r\n\r\n<em>Prayaas Performing Group</em>\r\nPRAYAAS is an emerging performing group of SUKRUPA. The group can perform Bharatanatyam, Katak, Contemporary Classical, Freestyle,  Bollywood and Folk Dance. 50% of the revenue generated from the performance is distributed as scholarships among the children who perform, and the other 50% goes into the developmental programs of SUKRUPA.\r\n\r\nThis is a great incentive for the children, considering that most of them are school dropouts who are inducted back into school through our after-school program. Enormous effort and resources go into training them through professional artists in different forms of dance, music, and theatre. The focus and skill is to spot the talents and create opportunities for the children to realize their dreams and grow as independent citizens.\r\n\r\n','What We Do','Our mission is to help underprivileged children escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy and ignorance, replacing these challenges with hope and the opportunities available to mainstream children.

Nagar, Bangalore and creates a safe, caring, and clean environment for the children to live and learn in while their parents work.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h1>Our Programs</h1>\r\nWe holistically nurture our children and provide:\r\n<ul class=\"lined\">\r\n	<li>Nutritious food each day</li>\r\n	<li>Academic instruction in day school and after school programs</li>\r\n	<li>Health care</li>\r\n	<li>Skills training</li>\r\n	<li>Opportunities to participate in sports and other recreational activities</li>\r\n	<li>Cultural opportunities and awareness</li>\r\n	<li>Training by professionals in dance, music and visual arts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Residential Program</h3>\r\nThe SUKRUPA residential program runs a stable, full-time home for up to 10 children. In this loving family environment, children who are orphaned, have single parents or come from families in crisis receive affection, nutrition and guidance. They are provided schooling, education, health care and nutrition, discipline, and mentoring so that they develop as any other child would.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"subarea lhside\" style=\"width:275px\">\r\n<h2>Why It Matters</h2>\r\nChildren at SUKRUPA come from urban slum communities around Bangalore. \r\n\r\nMany of them come from families whose monthly income is less than Rs. 2,000, which is <strong>less than $50.00</strong>. This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. \r\n\r\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in their communities.\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Sukrupa Education Center</h3>\r\nSUKRUPA Education Centre currently provides free schooling, nutritious food and basic health care to a population of over 400 children who thrive in a clean, safe, friendly and happy environment.\r\n\r\n<em>Student Eligibility and Parent Involvement</em>\r\nSUKRUPA conducts a strict screening process including home visits to determine below of poverty line status and requires a 14 to 16 year commitment of attendance. At the time of admission the parent makes an agreement with SUKRUPA to observe all rules and regulations and to attend child development training sessions every three months. Individual counseling is available per need.\r\n \r\n<em>The Curriculum</em>\r\nThe integrated curriculum at SUKRUPA is distinguished particularly by its emphasis on teaching the arts, social values and right attitude, in addition to academics as essential to a balanced education that produces young adults who are fiscally independent and personally responsible.\r\n\r\nSchool activities include:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"lined\">\r\n       	<li>Academics: Both innovative and traditional teaching methods</li>\r\n	<li>Languages: English, Kannada, Hindi, German and French</li>\r\n       	<li>Fine Arts</li>\r\n       	<li>Crafts</li>\r\n       	<li>Theater</li>\r\n       	<li>Indian and Western Classical Music and Dance</li>\r\n       	<li>Sports</li>\r\n       	<li>Club Projects in English, Math, Science, Geography, Sports and Horticulture</li>\r\n       	<li>Field Trips</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Youth Training Program</h3>\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens who have been child laborers or school drop-outs, the SUKRUPA Youth Training Program is a five year curriculum in personal life skills, social skills, leadership and academics studied through distance learning, provided by the state university.\r\n\r\nPractical training in teaching, accounting, sales, computers, conversational English, dance, design, hospitality, housekeeping and crafts, conforms to students’ interests and talents.\r\n\r\nYoung women become independent, rather than mothers at the age of 13 or 14. Young men become responsible providers for their families.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure continuous participation in this program, each student receives a monthly stipend to help cover family expenses.\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://sukrupa.localhost/content/krupaKids.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"lhside\" /></p><h3>SUKRUPA Outreach Program</h3>\r\n','What We Do','Our mission is to help underprivileged children escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy and ignorance, replacing these challenges with hope and the opportunities available to mainstream children.

This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. \r\n\r\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in their communities.\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Sukrupa Education Center</h3>\r\nSUKRUPA Education Centre currently provides free schooling, nutritious food and basic health care to a population of over 400 children who thrive in a clean, safe, friendly and happy environment.\r\n\r\n<em>Student Eligibility and Parent Involvement</em>\r\nSUKRUPA conducts a strict screening process including home visits to determine below of poverty line status and requires a 14 to 16 year commitment of attendance. At the time of admission the parent makes an agreement with SUKRUPA to observe all rules and regulations and to attend child development training sessions every three months. Individual counseling is available per need.\r\n \r\n<em>The Curriculum</em>\r\nThe integrated curriculum at SUKRUPA is distinguished particularly by its emphasis on teaching the arts, social values and right attitude, in addition to academics as essential to a balanced education that produces young adults who are fiscally independent and personally responsible.\r\n\r\nSchool activities include:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"lined\">\r\n       	<li>Academics: Both innovative and traditional teaching methods</li>\r\n	<li>Languages: English, Kannada, Hindi, German and French</li>\r\n       	<li>Fine Arts</li>\r\n       	<li>Crafts</li>\r\n       	<li>Theater</li>\r\n       	<li>Indian and Western Classical Music and Dance</li>\r\n       	<li>Sports</li>\r\n       	<li>Club Projects in English, Math, Science, Geography, Sports and Horticulture</li>\r\n       	<li>Field Trips</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Youth Training Program</h3>\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens who have been child laborers or school drop-outs, the SUKRUPA Youth Training Program is a five year curriculum in personal life skills, social skills, leadership and academics studied through distance learning, provided by the state university.\r\n\r\nPractical training in teaching, accounting, sales, computers, conversational English, dance, design, hospitality, housekeeping and crafts, conforms to students’ interests and talents.\r\n\r\nYoung women become independent, rather than mothers at the age of 13 or 14.

The ultimate goal of this program is to provide a path out of the slums for relocation to mainstream neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Rural Development Program</h3>\r\n\r\nThis pilot project addresses the challenges of rural poverty as the underlying cause for the formation of urban slums.

Nagar, Bangalore, providing a safe, caring, and clean environment for the children to live and learn in while their parents work.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h1>Our Programs</h1>\r\nWe holistically nurture our children and provide:\r\n<ul class=\"lined\">\r\n	<li>Nutritious food each day</li>\r\n	<li>Academic instruction in day school and after school programs</li>\r\n	<li>Health care</li>\r\n	<li>Skills training</li>\r\n	<li>Opportunities to participate in sports and other recreational activities</li>\r\n	<li>Cultural opportunities and awareness</li>\r\n	<li>Training by professionals in dance, music and visual arts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Residential Program</h3>\r\nThe SUKRUPA residential program runs a stable, full-time home for up to 10 children. In this loving family environment, children who are orphaned, have single parents or come from families in crisis receive affection, nutrition and guidance. They are provided schooling, education, health care and nutrition, discipline, and mentoring so that they develop as any other child would.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"subarea lhside\" style=\"width:275px\">\r\n<h2>Why It Matters</h2>\r\nChildren at SUKRUPA come from urban slum communities around Bangalore. \r\n\r\nMany of them come from families whose monthly income is less than Rs. 2,000, which is <strong>less than $50.00</strong>. This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. \r\n\r\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in their communities.\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Sukrupa Education Center</h3>\r\nSUKRUPA Education Centre currently provides free schooling, nutritious food and basic health care to a population of over 400 children who thrive in a clean, safe, friendly and happy environment.\r\n\r\n<em>Student Eligibility and Parent Involvement</em>\r\nSUKRUPA conducts a strict screening process including home visits to determine below of poverty line status and requires a 14 to 16 year commitment of attendance. At the time of admission the parent makes an agreement with SUKRUPA to observe all rules and regulations and to attend child development training sessions every three months. Individual counseling is available per need.\r\n \r\n<em>The Curriculum</em>\r\nThe integrated curriculum at SUKRUPA is distinguished particularly by its emphasis on teaching the arts, social values and right attitude, in addition to academics as essential to a balanced education that produces young adults who are fiscally independent and personally responsible.\r\n\r\nSchool activities include:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"lined\">\r\n       	<li>Academics: Both innovative and traditional teaching methods</li>\r\n	<li>Languages: English, Kannada, Hindi, German and French</li>\r\n       	<li>Fine Arts</li>\r\n       	<li>Crafts</li>\r\n       	<li>Theater</li>\r\n       	<li>Indian and Western Classical Music and Dance</li>\r\n       	<li>Sports</li>\r\n       	<li>Club Projects in English, Math, Science, Geography, Sports and Horticulture</li>\r\n       	<li>Field Trips</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Youth Training Program</h3>\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens who have been child laborers or school drop-outs, the SUKRUPA Youth Training Program is a five year curriculum in personal life skills, social skills, leadership and academics studied through distance learning, provided by the state university.\r\n\r\nPractical training in teaching, accounting, sales, computers, conversational English, dance, design, hospitality, housekeeping and crafts, conforms to students’ interests and talents.\r\n\r\nYoung women become independent, rather than mothers at the age of 13 or 14. Young men become responsible providers for their families.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure continuous participation in this program, each student receives a monthly stipend to help cover family expenses.\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://sukrupa.localhost/content/krupaKids.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"lhside\" /></p><h3>SUKRUPA Outreach Program</h3>\r\nThis pilot project includes students from the SUKRUPA Youth Training Program. It teaches English to underprivileged urban slum and rural children studying in Kannada Government Schools from Class 1 to Class 7. The children participate in creative activities like art, craft, music, dance, games, and language practice. In 2009, over 400 children participated in this pilot project. We hope to expand it when funding becomes available.\r\n\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Community Development Program</h3>\r\n\r\nFor women and young adults in the community, particularly the parents and siblings of the children who attend SUKRUPA Education Center, the Community Development Program offers health camps, family counseling, parenting and life skills training as well as vocational training, that constitutes a foundation for dignified employment and self-sufficiency. The ultimate goal of this program is to provide a path out of the slums for relocation to mainstream neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Rural Development Program</h3>\r\n\r\nThis pilot project addresses the challenges of rural poverty as the underlying cause for the formation of urban slums. SUKRUPA has established the project to include four villages in rural Bangalore. The program intends to provide pre-school activities, supplementary education for government school children and vocational training for young adults and older women. Future sources of revenue generation for the villages may include organic farming, dairy farming, and renewable energy.','What We Do','Our mission is to help underprivileged children escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy and ignorance, replacing these challenges with hope and the opportunities available to mainstream children.

This leads to a lack of basic needs &ndash; like education, health care, and nutrition &ndash; and often enters the children into a vicious cycle of child labor and life-long poverty. \r\n\r\nDeprivation, poverty, and emotional trauma are a norm, and some children go through severe turmoil and abuse at home and in their communities.\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Sukrupa Education Center</h3>\r\nSUKRUPA Education Centre currently provides free schooling, nutritious food and basic health care to a population of over 400 children who thrive in a clean, safe, friendly and happy environment.\r\n\r\n<em>Student Eligibility and Parent Involvement</em>\r\nSUKRUPA conducts a strict screening process including home visits to determine below of poverty line status and requires a 14 to 16 year commitment of attendance. At the time of admission the parent makes an agreement with SUKRUPA to observe all rules and regulations and to attend child development training sessions every three months. Individual counseling is available per need.\r\n \r\n<em>The Curriculum</em>\r\nThe integrated curriculum at SUKRUPA is distinguished particularly by its emphasis on teaching the arts, social values and right attitude, in addition to academics as essential to a balanced education that produces young adults who are fiscally independent and personally responsible.\r\n\r\nSchool activities include:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"lined\">\r\n       	<li>Academics: Both innovative and traditional teaching methods</li>\r\n	<li>Languages: English, Kannada, Hindi, German and French</li>\r\n       	<li>Fine Arts</li>\r\n       	<li>Crafts</li>\r\n       	<li>Theater</li>\r\n       	<li>Indian and Western Classical Music and Dance</li>\r\n       	<li>Sports</li>\r\n       	<li>Club Projects in English, Math, Science, Geography, Sports and Horticulture</li>\r\n       	<li>Field Trips</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Youth Training Program</h3>\r\n\r\nFor older children and teens who have been child laborers or school drop-outs, the SUKRUPA Youth Training Program is a five year curriculum in personal life skills, social skills, leadership and academics studied through distance learning, provided by the state university.\r\n\r\nPractical training in teaching, accounting, sales, computers, conversational English, dance, design, hospitality, housekeeping and crafts, conforms to students’ interests and talents.\r\n\r\nYoung women become independent, rather than mothers at the age of 13 or 14.

Young men become responsible providers for their families.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure continuous participation in this program, each student receives a monthly stipend to help cover family expenses.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"lhside\" src=\"http://sukrupa.localhost/content/krupaKids.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Outreach Program</h3>\r\nThis pilot project includes students from the SUKRUPA Youth Training Program. It teaches English to underprivileged urban slum and rural children studying in Kannada Government Schools from Class 1 to Class 7. The children participate in creative activities like art, craft, music, dance, games, and language practice. In 2009, over 400 children participated in this pilot project. We hope to expand it when funding becomes available.\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Community Development Program</h3>\r\nFor women and young adults in the community, particularly the parents and siblings of the children who attend SUKRUPA Education Center, the Community Development Program offers health camps, family counseling, parenting and life skills training as well as vocational training, that constitutes a foundation for dignified employment and self-sufficiency. The ultimate goal of this program is to provide a path out of the slums for relocation to mainstream neighborhoods.\r\n<h3>SUKRUPA Rural Development Program</h3>\r\nThis pilot project addresses the challenges of rural poverty as the underlying cause for the formation of urban slums. SUKRUPA has established the project to include four villages in rural Bangalore. The program intends to provide pre-school activities, supplementary education for government school children and vocational training for young adults and older women. Future sources of revenue generation for the villages may include organic farming, dairy farming, and renewable energy.','What We Do','Our mission is to help deprived children and young adults escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy, and ignorance thereby creating opportunities for their integration into mainstream society.','inherit','open','open','','14-revision-35','','','2011-02-21 15:44:28','2011-02-21 15:44:28','',14,'http://sukrupa.localhost/uncategorized/14-revision-35/',0,'revision','',0);

Our mission is to help deprived children and young adults escape a background of poverty, slum life, illiteracy, and ignorance thereby creating opportunities for their integration into mainstream society.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal for all SUKRUPA’s <a href=\"/activities\">activities</a> is to provide to all its participants, the knowledge and skills for dignified and sustainable living.\r\n\r\nSUKRUPA’s ultimate vision is to make a significant contribution toward the elimination of urban slums and rural poverty.\r\n\r\nSUKRUPA is registered under Section 80(G) and all donations are tax deductible under the rules of the Income Tax Department of India. We are also registered under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) and are eligible to receive donations in foreign currency.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"dropcap\">T</span>he story of SUKRUPA starts with Suguna, in a small scale industrial neighborhood in Bangalore in 1971 when she invited neighborhood children into her home to teach them when their parents were working. First with eight kids, she taught all subjects as an after school program. By 1981, she was teaching 150 children, as they spilled out into the yard. Her daughter Krupa and son Sathya grew up in this environment, and they would teach students in the grade below them. Sathya went on to become a software professional, and Krupa became a successful entrepreneur. By 2001, her pursuits led her through India, Italy, Brazil, Japan, Malaysia, Srilanka, and Indonesia into the granite industry in the United States. This history combined a fundamental belief in the importance of education and a global perspective on the social problems of India. \r\n\r\nOut of a passion to create opportunities for deprived children, Krupa ended her lucrative career in the United States after a four-week vacation to India during summer of 2002. She setup SUKRUPA and then in 2008, created the social enterprise SUKRUPA Creations, which employs the children\'s parents.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"subarea lhside\">\r\n<h2>Our People</h2>\r\nThe Board consists of highly successful professionals, with a vision and passion to work with underprivileged children. The Board is involved in planning and developing the many programs here at SUKRUPA.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Ms. Krupalatha Martin Dass, Founder/Executive Director</strong> &mdash; Krupa is an entrepreneur and has been a consultant in the international market for over a decade in the granite industry. Her compassion for underprivileged and deprived children made her leave a comfortable life in the US and return to her home city Bangalore to create opportunities for such children.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>S. Jayaraman, Trustee</strong> &mdash; Mr. S. Jayaraman, is a vibrant personality who is on the corporate ladder in the IT industry and is also a humanitarian involved in various social activities on a personal level and a dedicated Rotarian. His skills range from marketing consultant to facilitator to fundraiser. Jayaraman has been a consultant to the Azim Premji Foundation and fundraiser for Akshayapatra-meals scheme.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Manu Konchady, Trustee</strong> &mdash; Mr. Manu has over 15 years experience in IT industry. Manu has volunteered in catholic charities and several other NGO’s in the USA and India. Currently he is actively involved with the Child Education and Welfare Association.
