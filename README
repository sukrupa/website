SUGGESTED PHP CODING STANDARDS

INITIAL SETUP
In order to install the sukrupa-website run 
./mac.sh (if you are a mac user)
./linux.sh (if you are a linux user)
NOTE: these scripts should only ever be run once. To start and stop XAMPP use the XAMPP control panel.
For windows installation refer to the manual steps in mingle instance
Next, with XAMPP running, run ". ./install-hooks.sh" (This will install some git hooks that will import and export the wordpress database from a dump file upon commit and pull respectively, reflecting any changes in database into the git repository). This script only needs to be run once, the hooks operate automagically from here on :)


AUTOMATION
http://beta.phpformatter.com/

Suggest using the following settings :

Indentation style : K&R Style. (PEAR style is hard to read.)
Indent with : Tabs.
Starting indentation : 0.
Indentation : 1.
Remove empty lines : (True.)
Align assignments statements nicely : (True.)

(No other options selected.)

Initial results are largely positive.

SHORT TAGS
<? ... ?>
Not to be used, since not all web hosts support them. Use:

<?php ... ?>
Instead.

INDENTATION
Indent code using tabs, not spaces.

LINE TERMINATION
Use Linux / Unix style line endings (LF)

COMMENTS
/* Style */
Type commenting for informative messages and developer info.

// Single line comments.
For warnings or critical information.

FILE PERMISSIONS
I'm not sure what the effect of permissions on a Windows box is, but 755 is web viewable for *nix.
