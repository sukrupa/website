The main icon set we currently use is:
http://wefunction.com/2008/07/function-free-icon-set/

Please try to use these icons where possible to ensure that the design of the pages is consistent.

We will try to remove older icons from the site and use these instead.

When you need to use an icon, just extract that one from the zipped folder. This helps us to keep track
of the icons being currently used.

All the icons are 48X48, by default. You may resize it to 32X32 if you need a smaller one.
You can even make them 16x16 but please remember that people may find it hard to click on this small target.
