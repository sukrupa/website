To get PHPUnit set up on Mac OSX - need to find a better way:
1) Install pear
2) You will probably have to upgrade pear (and possibly force it):
sudo pear upgrade --force http://pear.php.net/get/PEAR-1.9.3
3) Install PHPUnit (using pear):
sudo pear install http://pear.phpunit.de/get/PHPUnit-3.5.14.tgz
Notes: this should install a bunch of stuff including things like a code coverage tool.
4) Try running the tests in IntelliJ - they will probably say you need to edit the php.ini file.
cd /private/etc/
cp php.ini.default php.ini
5) Open php.ini in your editor and find 'include_path' which is commented out using a semi-colon (;):
6) Change it to read:
include_path = "/usr/lib/php/PEAR:/php/includes:/usr/lib/php"

** GOTCHAS - to fix **
1) For some reason right clicking on an individual unit test and selecting run gives the error:
"PHP Fatal error:  Class 'PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase' not found in"
However, running all in 'unit-tests' folder works as does right clicking inside the class in the file - BUT NOT ABOVE THE CLASS!
