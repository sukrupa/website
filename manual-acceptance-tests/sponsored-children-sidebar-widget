Feature: Sponsored children sidebar widget


    Scenario: Sponsored children sidebar widget is displayed with the correct information

        Given I am on the sukrupa.org home page
        Then I should see sponsored children widget
        And I should see a link to the sponsorship form page
        And I should see a progress bar
        And I should see the total number of students in the school
        And I should see the total number of sponsored students in the school

    Scenario: Sponsored children sidebar widget changes when another student gets sponsored
        Given I am on the sukrupa.org home page
        And there are 300 students sponsored
        When I sponsor another child
        And I navigate back to the hope page
        Then I should see that there are 301 students sponsored
